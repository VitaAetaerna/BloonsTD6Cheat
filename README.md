# BloonsTD6Cheat
Please use at your OWN RISK.       !I assume !NO! Liabillity!
No AntiCheat Bypass, you can easily get banned but bloons is just taking your InGame Money and other useless stuff ?lol?

1. Make a Snapshot of your Current running Processes and run through them while checking if the process list contains the BloonsTd6 Process.
2. After sucessfully getting the Process Name, get the Base Adress of it.
3. Same thing as the Process finding, but this time I am not making a Snapshot of the Process List but of the Modules of the BloonsTd6 Process.
4. Do what you want now, process is initialized, u have base Memory Adress.
5. What you looking for, get the pointers of your Game now? Oh you want to use the Cheat.
6. I mean you have GUI, can't you read?
